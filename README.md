Decentralized Voting: Votes are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, providing an immutable and transparent record.
IPFS for Image Storage: Candidate images are stored on IPFS, ensuring decentralized and reliable image storage.
Real-Time Vote Tallying: The voting results are updated in real-time, providing immediate feedback on the election outcome.
Role-Based Access Control: Ensures that only authorized users can perform specific actions, enhancing security.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React, Next.js
Backend: Ethereum Smart Contracts (Solidity)
Blockchain: Ethereum
Storage: IPFS (for image storage)
Wallet Integration: MetaMask
